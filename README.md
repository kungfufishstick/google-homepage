This is a project that is found at the Odin Project. In this repository I will be following the project and deconstructing an existing web page. I will then rebuild it. 

I want to gain a better understanding of it all so I can become a great front-end developer. Eventually becoming a back-end dev and tying everything together to be a lead web developer and designer for a future business venture.
